# Deep Learning

This repository contains my solutions to the weekly assignments from a comprehensive Deep Learning course covering fundamental and current topics in the field. The course introduces the principles of training deep neural networks—including backpropagation, stochastic gradient descent, and regularization—alongside the most common architectures: convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and transformers. Each weekly assignment involves implementing and training models from scratch in PyTorch for diverse tasks such as image classification, machine translation, reasoning problems, few-shot learning, and generative modeling. The curriculum also covers recent advances including unsupervised and self-supervised learning, flow-based models, generative adversarial networks, denoising autoencoders, and large language models. Through hands-on implementation, I've gained both theoretical understanding and practical experience in applying deep learning to real-world datasets.
